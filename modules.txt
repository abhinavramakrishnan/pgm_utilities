                                                Main modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pgmEcho
- This module will echo the input file to the output file. It will the echoFile to do it.

pgmComp
- This module will read two files (binary or ASCII) using either readASCII or readBinary and store them in two 
separte pgm file structs. Then it will use the logicallyEquivalent module to compare both the files.

pgma2b
- This module will convert an ASCII pgm to a binary pgm. It will do this by using the readASCII module to read in an 
ASCII file and store it in a 2D array. Then writeBinary will be used to write the data in the 2D array into 
a binary file.

pgmb2a
- This module will convert a binary pgm to a ASCII pgm. It will do this does this by using the readBinary 
module to read in a binary file and store it in a 2D array. Then writeASCII will be used to write the 2D array into an ASCII 
into an ASCII file.

pgmReduce
- This module takes the input file and reduces it by the facoter n in each diemsion. It will do this by reading 
in the file using either readASCII or readBinary. Then it will use the reduceSize to reduce the size of the 
2D array. Finaly it will be written to a file using either writeASCII or writeBinary.

pgmTile
This program takes 3 arguments, an input file (either ASCII or binary), a tiling factor n, and an 
output file name template. It will then divide the input file into n*n smaller images corresponding to 
parts of the image.

pgmAssemble
This programme will be used to assemble a large image from smaller ones.





                                                Helper modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

initialise.c
- This module is used to intial pgmFile structs. It will be used in the pgmEcho, pgmComp, pgmReduce, pgmTile 
and pgmAssemble programs.

echoFile
- This module is used to make copies of a file. It will be used in the pgmEcho program.

readASCII.c
- This module will read in an ASCII file and store it as pgmFile struct. It will be used in the pgmEcho, pgmComp, 
pgma2b, pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.

readBinary.c
- This module will read in an binary file and store it as pgmFile struct. It will be used in the pgmEcho, pgmComp, 
pgmb2a, pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.

writeASCII.c
- Produce an ASCII output file when it is given a pgmFile struct. It will be used in the pgmEcho, pgmb2a, 
pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.

writeBinary.c
- Produce a binary output file when it is given a pgmFile struct. It will be used in the pgmEcho, pgma2b, 
pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.
 
logicallyEquivalent
- This module will check to see if two pgm files are logically equivalent. This means it will compare the 
values in the files whilst ignoring whitespace. 

reduceSize.c
- This module will take the height and width of a pgm file and reduce it by the specified scale factor. 
It will be used in the pgmReduce program. It will be used in the pgmReduce program.

tileImage.c
- This module will be used to split a file into smaller files. It will be used in the pgmTile program.

fileType.c
- This module will be used to determine whether a given pgm is ASCII or Binary. It will be used in the pgmEcho,
 pgmComp, pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.

error.c
- This module will take in an error code and print out the appropriate erro message. It will be used in the 
pgmEcho, pgmComp, pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.

cleanUp.c
This module will free up any allocated memory. The purpose of this function is to cleanup if an error occurs 
in the code. It will be used in the pgmEcho, pgmComp, pgmReduce, pgmTile and pgmAssemble programs.
