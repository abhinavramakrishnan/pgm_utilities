Firstly I will execute each function(module) in the program on pen and paper. Next I will form some 
test cases to test the programs, ensuring that the test cases include normal values, edges cases and 
invalid values. Boundaries such as zero, maximum and minimum values will also be tested for. I will 
ensure that I am regression testing by running all the tests after every modification.
